It can result in low productivity, trust issues, and even conflicts. Individuals with disabilities may have a harder time adapting to our hegemonic wasy of life, however this doesnt mean they are unable to work with us still. Many disabled bodies arent afforded the same job opportunities as others becasue theyre seen as "challenged" or "unable", even if they are fully capabe in completeing such tasks.</p>

                <div class="container"><p>I want to start with the experience of a boy named Justin. He is a disabled man with ADD (attention deficit disorder, now known as ADHD, or Attention-deficit /hyperactivity disorder), Soon after, he developed Meniere disease (an inner ear disorder), which causes him to lose his ability to hear or balance. Justin has mentioned that he was maliciously pranked by his supervisor. His supervisor moved his mouth but make no sounds, making Justin think he had gone deaf, until his supervisor laughed out loud. Here, we are just using the Justin’s example, but we still have many such "supervisors" and such "Justin" in our society today. Discrimination still exists, which is why we are focusing on our topic -- Discrimination towards physical disabilities in the workplace. Discrimination still exists, but so does fairness and justice. Institutions and laws are protecting more "Justin" from justice and fairness. But this is far from enough, we also hope that more people can participate in the process of helping to achieve a real fairness.<br>Disability Discrmination in the workplace is a very real and relevant topic. Many Americans are denied job oppritunties and cannot provide for their families. Without a paid postion many fall below the poverty line, 52 percent to be exact. This shocking statstic affects way too many people. In our portfolio section there is a basic education on this ongoing issue. Once all the facts and data are recieved, a call to action could be to visit the Project When. Project When is a group based out of Ohio. They combat all forms of workplace discrimination with a focus on disibility. This group has multiple meetings per year that are virtual and are free to attend. The social media of Project When is linked below. We encourage everyone to at least to take a look and read the mission statment. The information is very similar to our website but includes the specific steps that are being taken in order to combat this issue. All of our group members are supportive of a chnage revolving around Disability Discrimination in the workplace. All of our group members are very passionate about this issue. We decided to further draw attention to this issue because of personal experinces and relevance to this course. Disabled people already face numerous challenges every day, the workplace should not add unnessesary stress in thier lives. We thank you for your time and hope that you join us and Project When in reform and justice for this issue.<br>Workplace disability discrimination is not as popular as issue as racial justice or major diseases, it is often overlooked. It is in fact a real issue in this country. More people need to draw attention and work towards a resolution on this issue. As previously mentioned this portion of workers makes up more than a quarter of all production output. Without these human beings the United States would not be anywhere near where we are today. These people are crucial to sucess in the economy, they deserve much better treatment than others to be harrased, joked upon, excluded, and many other horrible forms of discrimination. Project When and many other organizations recognize this. These people are the same as everyone else, Americans, working hard to earn thier pay. There is no logical reason for any of this to be happening. That is why as a group we chose to act upon this and get involved. Discrimination of any form is horrible, but also very easily avoidable. Humans need to realize the importance of every single person in this world, especially a group of over 60 million adults. The contribtuions to this world that 60 million can make are beyond belief. We truly hope you can join our fight and do something about this ongoing issue across the world.   </p>

The title of this image may be their organization. In the space where this is all typed, you will talk about them. If they are an organization, you may include their mission statement or their spokesperson or representative image. If it is literature, be sure to include significant evidence here. You may want to pull a quote (if you do, include in-text citation) and you may want to pull a photo of scholar/speaker from the internet. Make sure it is covered under your license, especially if you have made your website public.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">More than 60 million adults are physically disabled in the United States. With just over 200 million total adults living in this country over a fourth of them need some sort of income. These people need purpose in thier lives. The United States economy needs workers for output and production. Our country cannot go without this large portion of the population being accepted in the workplace. People with a physical disability are crucial for the United States economy, they contribute more than 34 percent of total production of goods and services. There have been multiple peices of legislation that have passed trying to prevent employers from discriminating. This would include title 12 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act amongst others. Employers are not so much the problem as shown in the video. Employees harrasing one another over little issues or even apperance is the problem across the country today. Most of the legislation regarding this issue is at the national level. This is touched upon in the video. States have little power when it comes to prosecuting individuals who break these rules in the workplace. With multiple offenses individuals are often let go in the position or recive warnings. Criminal charges are rare in cases, only for repeat extreme offenders. This video gives a very general overview of what disability discrimination in the workplace looks like with multiple specific examples and famous court cases associated with the topic. There are no warnings needed for this video. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4"><br>This PDF is about decreasing the amount of discrimination towards disabled bodies. It was a study done where employees were put into three groups, a control, education, or contact group and had an intervention where they were shown videos to increase their knowledge. After the experiment, it was found that for a very short period of time, discrimination was reduced, however did not last long. This was due to the fact that the information from the videos was just learned, not retained. So, if employers made employees watch interactive videos to confirm they understand, discrimination can decrease. Along with these countermeasures seminars and meetings involving statistics and possible punishments could be layed out. Being introduced and aware of the issue is half of the battle. Many of the people in the workplace do not know how common or how big of an issue this can be in work enviroments. The videos are a great way to introduce what the issue is about. Our group has a perfect video that is both specific yet effective. This could potentially be used by employers to create awarness and prevent this horrible issue from being done. The research is proven that once aware of something humans tend to do it less as shown in the video study. The PDF file does a great job of in depth describing what and how people are discriminatory. This is quite lengthy as the examples are numerous. The basic information inside reveals how physical disability discrimination is more common than the average American thinks and how to combat it. All of the research is done by students at the University of North Carolina. Trigger Warning there are talk of phyiscal violence and abuse during the middle section of the thesis. Overall it does a great job of gathering data and producing theories on why this occurs in our country. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Project WHEN is all about ending workplace harassment. Under this project, one of their goals is to stop disability discrimination in workplaces. Their mission as a whole is to elevate awareness to eliminate harassment and create more respectful workplaces. The project started in 2016 with many personal stories and court cases of discrimination occuring in the state of Ohio. With any cause citizens were fed up and tired of receiving this treatment. With generous donations the group was able to start up and hold monthly virtual and in person meetings discussing new news on the topic, legislation, and national court cases. Based on the website the group is very close and many of them have experienced some level of discrimination on the job. Many of the members live in the same area and work in the same factory. The group was nationally recognized for thier efforts in Washington D.C. at the start of 2020. They recieved multiple awards for there time and efforts spent bringing this issue to light nationally. The group plans to keep spreading the word and nationally recongize this issue. So far they have reached outposts in 33 states and plan to continue this journey. The twitter is linked below which has even more in depth information about the organization. Even with the pandemic they are active and reaching out to victims across the country and world. If you go onto their website, projectwhen.org, you will find places to donate, and many ways to stop and prevent discrimination. Our group felt that this group had the right approach when going about this issue. There are multiple others working towards a common goal, but through education and peace this group is acheiving sucess. Many others are using a scare technique which is effective, but not something our group stands for. Project When is a great group fighting against this common issue in the United States.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">This imgae reflects how society as a whole tends to ostracize physically disabled people from themselves, ultimately pushing those away from hegomonic ideals. In the book "Discrimination at Work", written by Adrienne Colella, she discusses how those with physical disabilities hace a harder time adapting and performing in workplaces due to the lack of adaptions for them. Related to the image though, it still further highlilghts how those that are disabled do not have as many opportuities compared to those that arent in thier position. Such differneces can include wages, rights, and even the way people interact with them. The book goes into the many ways in which employers can adapt to the disabiity to an individual. Most of these soltuions do not require any cost, or a very little one. Cost is one of the main concerns when it comes to having disabled employees. Companies do not want to spend a lot when they could hire someone perfectly able and not have too. With the remote job market growing this is not so much an issue. For those in person different types of desks, chairs and computers allow for those physically disabled to complete thier tasks. Prices of such items are similar to those of the previous equipment making the only cost time in setting it up. Recent times have allowed for those disabled to be easily integrated into the workplace. For those who are blind or have hearing imparments there is computer software that can scan anything including physical diagrams and cater towards there needs. This allows everyone on a team to understand everything clearly. Many large companies also have seminars and meetings on how to adress those disabled to create a safe enviroment. These rules are not always adheared by. </p>
